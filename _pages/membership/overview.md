The Readium community is supported by organizations that join the Readium Foundation as members. Member organizations typically use Readium technologies to build client or server solutions. You can participate in a Readium open source project or use Readium technologies without being a member, but membership is an important way to support the community.

Find out more about joining Readium Foundation [here](http://readium.org/membership/join/).
